using pywebio, write a python class that
1. receives images one by one from an iterator or a callback function, whichever is easier.
   The iterator object is called traverser, and the callback function is called traverser.next_file().
   The traverser and the class Traverser are already implemented, so you can use them to instantiate
   traverser=Traverser(dir_path) and don't need to generate any code for them.
2. Displays each image in a browser window with an area below the image to enter text. The area is
   called "Face name: ", and the user enters the text. If the text is not filled in, return empty string.
3. Place two buttons below the image: one button is labelled "Next image" and the other button is labelled "Quit"
4. If the user presses Next image before entering anything, return empty string.
5. If the user enters some text, return the text as a string to the program and store the string in a list of strings.
